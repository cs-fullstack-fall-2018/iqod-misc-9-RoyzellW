Create a function that will get the minimum and maximum numbers of a dynamic array. Do NOT use a javascript function, do this manually. Try to do this without Googling it, you only need one loop.

Once complete push to this repo.

Note:
A dynamic array is referring to an array of any size that can be filled with any number and work every time.
